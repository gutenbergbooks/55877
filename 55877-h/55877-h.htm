<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></div>

<p class="drop-cap">D H. Lawrence is one of the most significant of the new generation
of writers just beginning to appear in England. One of their chief
marks is that they seem to step forward full-grown, without a history
to account for their maturity. Another characteristic is that they
frequently spring from social layers which in the past had to remain
largely voiceless. And finally, they have all in their blood what
their elders had to acquire painfully: that is, an evolutionary
conception of life.</p>

<p class="p-left1">Three years ago the author of "The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd" was
wholly unknown, having not yet published a single work. To-day he has
to his credit three novels&mdash;"The White Peacock," "The Trespasser"
and "Sons and Lovers"&mdash;a collection of verse entitled "Love Poems,"
and the play contained in this volume. All of these works, but in
particular the play and the latest novel, prove their author a man
gifted with a strikingly original vision, a keen sense of beauty, an
equally keen sense of verbal values, and a sincerity, which makes him
see and tell the truth where even the most audacious used to falter in
the past. Flaubert himself was hardly less free from the old curse of
sentimentalizing compromise&mdash;and yet this young writer knows how to
tell the utmost truth with a daintiness that puts offence out of the
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<p class="p-left1">He was born twenty-seven years ago in a coal-miner's cottage at
the little colliery town of Eastwood, on the border line between
Nottingham and Derbyshire. The home was poor, yet not without certain
aspirations and refinements. It was the mother who held it together,
who saved it from a still more abject poverty, and who filled it with
a spirit that made it possible for the boy&mdash;her youngest son&mdash;to keep
alive the gifts still slumbering undiscovered within him. In "Sons and
Lovers" we get the picture of just such a home and such a mother, and
it seems safe to conclude that the novel in question is in many ways
autobiographical.</p>

<p class="p-left1">At the age of twelve the boy won a County Council Scholarship&mdash;and
came near having to give it up because he found that the fifteen
pounds a year conferred by it would barely pay the fees at the
Nottingham High School and the railway fares to that city. But his
mother's determination and self-sacrifice carried him safely past the
seemingly impossible. At sixteen he left school to earn his living
as a clerk. Illness saved him from that uncongenial fate. Instead he
became a teacher, having charge of a class of colliers' boys in one of
those rough, old-fashioned British schools where all the classes used
to fight against one another within a single large room. Before the
classes convened in the morning, at eight o'clock, he himself received
instruction from the head-master; at night he continued his studies
in the little kitchen at home, where all the rest of the family were
wont to fore gather. At nineteen he found himself, to his own and
everybody else's astonishment, the first on the list of the King's
Scholarship examination, and from that on he was, to use his own
words, "considered clever." But the lack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> twenty pounds needed in a
lump sum to pay the entrance fee at the training college for teachers
made it impossible for him to make use of the gained advantage.</p>

<p class="p-left1">Two years later, however, he succeeded in matriculating at the
Nottingham Day Training College. But by that time the creative impulse
had already begun to stir within him, aided by an early love affair,
and so he wrote poems and worked at his first novel when he should
have been studying. At twenty-three he left the college and went to
London to teach school, to study French and German, and to write. At
twenty-five he had his first novel&mdash;"The White Peacock"&mdash;accepted and
printed. But the death of his mother only a month before that event
made his victory seem useless and joyless. After the publication of
his second novel, in 1912, he became able to give up teaching in
order to devote himself entirely to his art. Out of that leisure&mdash;and
perhaps also out of the sorrow caused by the loss of her who until
then had been the mainspring of his life&mdash;came "Sons and Lovers" and
"The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd."</p>

<p class="p-left1">What has struck me most deeply in these two works&mdash;apart from
their splendid craftsmanship&mdash;is their psychological penetration,
so closely paralleling the most recent conclusions of the world's
leading thinkers. In the hands of this writer, barely emerged out of
obscurity, sex becomes almost a new thing. Not only the relationship
between man and woman, but also that of mother and child is laid bare
in a new light which startles&mdash;or even shocks&mdash;but which nevertheless
compels acceptance. One might think that Mr. Lawrence had carefully
studied and employed the very latest theories of such men as Freud,
for instance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span> yet it is a pretty safe bet that most of his
studies have been carried on in his own soul, within his own memories.
Thus it is proved once more that what the student gropingly reasons
out for abstract formulation is flashed upon the poetic dreamer in
terms of living reality.</p>

<p class="p-left1">Another thing that has impressed me is the aspect in which Mr.
Lawrence presents the home life of those hitherto submerged classes
which are now at last reaching out for a full share in the general
social and cultural inheritance. He writes of that life, not only with
a knowledge obtained at first hand, but with a sympathy that scorns
any apologetic phrase-mongering. Having read him, one feels inclined
to conclude, in spite of all conflicting testimony, that the slum
is not a location, but a state of mind, and that everywhere, on all
levels, the individual soul may create around itself an atmosphere
expressive of its ideals. A book like "Sons and Lovers" ought to go
far to prove that most of the qualities held peculiar to the best
portion of the "ruling classes" are nothing but the typical marks of
normal humanity.</p>

<h2>THE WIDOWING OF MRS. HOLROYD</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST ACT</h3>

<h4>SCENE I</h4>

<p class="p-left1"><i>The kitchen of a miner's small cottage. On the left is the fireplace,
with a deep, full red fire. At the back is a white-curtained window,
and beside it the outer door of the room. On the right, two white
wooden stairs intrude into the kitchen below the closed stair foot
door. On the left, another door.</i></p>

<p class="p-left1"><i>The room is furnished with a chintz-backed sofa under the window, a
glass-knobbed painted dresser on the right, and in the centre, toward
the fire, a table with a red and blue check tablecloth. On one side
of the hearth is a wooden rocking-chair, on the other an armchair of
round staves. An unlighted copper-shaded lamp hangs from the raftered
ceiling. It is dark twilight, with the room full of warm fireglow. A
woman enters from the outer door. As she leaves the door open behind
her, the colliery rail can be seen not far from the threshold, and,
away back, the headstocks of a pit.</i></p>

<p class="p-left1"><i>The woman is tall and voluptuously built. She carries a basket heaped
full of washing, which she has just taken from the clotheslines
outside. Setting down the basket heavily, she feels among the
clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> She lifts out a white heap of sheets and other linen,
setting it on the table; then she takes a woollen shirt in her hand.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span> (<i>aloud, to herself</i>)</p>

<p class="left1">You know they're not dry even now, though it's been as fine as it has.
(<i>She spreads the shirt on the back of her rocking-chair, which she
turns to the fire</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">VOICE</span> (<i>calling from outside</i>)</p>

<p class="left1">Well, have you got them dry?</p>

<p class="left1">[<i>Mrs. Holroyd starts up, turns and flings her hand in the direction
of the open door, where appears a man in blue overalls, swarfed and
greased. He carries a dinner-basket.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">You&mdash;you&mdash;I don't know what to call you! The idea of shouting at me

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">It's only just gone six. We electricians, you know, we're the

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>)</p>

<p class="left1">Dunno! He'd got a game on somewhere&mdash;toffed himself up to the nines,
and skedaddled off as brisk as a turkey-cock. (<i>She smirks in front
of the mirror hanging on the chimney-piece, in imitation of a man
brushing his hair and moustache and admiring himself</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span> (<i>recovering herself, coldly</i>)</p>

<p class="left1">Yes. And they ought to be in. (<i>She continues placing the flannel
garments before the fire, on the fender and on chair-backs, till the
stove is hedged in with a steaming fence; then she takes a sheet in a
bundle from the table, and going up to Blackmore, who stands watching
her, says</i>) Here, take hold, and help me fold it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

thirty, in a close-fitting dress and a giddy, frilled bonnet of pink

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">And not have married him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">I might never have known you&mdash;I married him to get out of my place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">I was left an orphan when I was six. My Uncle John brought me up, in
the Coach and Horses at Rainsworth. He'd got no children. He was good
to me, but he drank. I went to Mansfield Grammar School. Then he fell
out with me because I wouldn't wait in the bar, and I went as nursery
governess to Berryman's. And I felt I'd nowhere to go, I belonged to
nowhere, and nobody cared about me, and men came after me, and I hated
it. So to get out of it, I married the first man that turned up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">And you never cared about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">Yes, I did. I did care about him. I wanted to be a wife to him. But
there's nothing at the bottom of him, if you know what I mean. You
can't <i>get</i> anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> with him. There's just his body and nothing
else. Nothing that keeps him, no anchor, no roots, nothing satisfying.
It's a horrible feeling there is about him, that nothing is safe or
permanent&mdash;nothing is anything&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">And do you think you can trust <i>me</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">I think you're different from him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">Perhaps I'm not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span> (<i>warmly</i>)</p>

<p class="left1">You are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">At any rate, we'll see. You'll come on Saturday to London?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">Well, you see, there's my money. I haven't got it yet. My uncle has
left me about a hundred and twenty pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">Well, see the lawyer about it as soon as you can. I can let you have
some money if you want any. But don't let us wait after Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">But isn't it wrong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

<p class="left1">Why, if you don't care for him, and the children are miserable between
the two of you&mdash;which they are&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">BLACKMORE</span></p>

one way, whatever you do. Damn him, he doesn't matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">No.</p>

The table is half laid, with a large cup and saucer, plate, etc.,
ready for Holroyd's dinner, which, like all miners, he has when he
comes home between four and five o'clock. On the other half of the
table Mrs. Holroyd is ironing. On the hearth stands newly baked loaves
of bread. The irons hang at the fire.</i></p>

<p class="p-left1"><i>Jack, with a bowler hat hanging at the back of his head, parades up
to the sofa, on which stands Minnie engaged in dusting a picture. She

<p><span class="smcap">GRANDMOTHER</span></p>

"sufferance" in the house with me. It is <i>I</i> who have lived on
sufferance, for his service and pleasure. No, what he wanted was the
drink and the public house company, and because he couldn't get them
here, he went out for them. That's all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">GRANDMOTHER</span></p>

<p class="left1">You have always been very clever at hitting things off, Lizzie. I was

bit of coaxing and managing, and you clever women won't do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">GRANDMOTHER</span></p>

<p class="left1">It's a pity your stomach wasn't too high for him, before you had him.
But no, you could have eaten him ravishing at one time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">MRS. HOLROYD</span></p>

<p class="left1">It's a pity you didn't tell me what he was before I had him. But no,

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
